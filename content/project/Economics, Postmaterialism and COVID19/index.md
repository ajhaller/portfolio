## Introduction

We all know that forgiving someone in particular situations is sometimes easier said than done. Whether this is an easy or difficult choice usually depends on several factors. Who are you forgiving? What did they do? Can it be fixed, or is the damage done beyond repair? This project focuses on the factor I've called Percieved Emotional Damage (PED), which is described as how much the person who's granting forgiveness, feels they've been hurt emotionally by the person who asks for forgiveness.
