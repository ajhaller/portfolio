# BELLABEAT CASE STUDY

## New and Upcoming Business in Women's Health
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women; but Bellabeat can grow so much more! Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, Bellabeat's founders, know that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth.

### Business Objective:
Focus on one Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices.

### Questions to Consider:
What are some trends in smart device usage?
How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### Steps & Notes for Preparation:
Datasets information: Contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty-three eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. This dataset was derived from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, which establishes reliablity, orginality, and credibility.

Tools: R is able to clean, transform, analyze and visualize data all in one place. The datasets I've used are small enough to work in R, if not SQL would have been used.
